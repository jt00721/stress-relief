# stress-relief
Stress relief is a universal need, and an app designed to help manage stress through guided exercises or timers has immediate, practical value.

## Goals & Features:

### Core Features:
    A guided breathing exercise timer that runs concurrently with background animations or music.
    Timed notifications or reminders for relaxation breaks.
    A simple dashboard to track usage statistics (e.g., sessions completed, average session duration).
### Focus:
    Implement concurrency using goroutines and channels for managing timers and background tasks.
    Integrate these features into a clean, responsive web app.
    Deploy the app and polish documentation.

## Breakdown by Day:

### Define Scope & Set Up Project

    Define the app’s core features (guided exercises, timers, notifications, analytics).
    Create the project folder structure and initialize the Go module.
    Install required libraries (Gin, GORM, godotenv, and any UI libraries you choose).

### Implement the Guided Breathing Timer with Concurrency

    Write a function to start a timer for a breathing exercise.
    Launch this timer as a goroutine using the go keyword.
    Set up a channel to notify when the timer completes.

### Build Additional Background Tasks

    Implement concurrent background tasks (e.g., scheduling notifications or updating session logs) using goroutines and channels.
    Ensure these tasks run independently without blocking the main app.

### Develop the Backend API

    Set up API endpoints for starting, stopping, and tracking stress relief sessions.
    Connect these endpoints to the concurrent functions (e.g., breathing timer, notification scheduler).

### Create the Frontend & Integrate with Backend

    Develop HTML templates to display the timer, notifications, and session statistics.
    Use a framework like TailwindCSS to polish the UI.
    Connect the frontend to the backend API for real-time updates.

### Testing, Debugging & UI Enhancements

    Test all concurrent functions with Go’s race detector (go run -race).
    Debug any issues with synchronization or deadlocks.
    Refine the UI based on testing feedback.

### Final Testing, Documentation & Deployment

    Conduct end-to-end testing of the app.
    Update documentation to include a section on how concurrency is implemented.
    Deploy the app on a platform such as Heroku or Railway.
